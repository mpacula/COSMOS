abstract = {SUMMARY: Efficient workflows to shepherd clinically-generated genomic data through the multiple stages of a next-generation sequencing (NGS) pipeline is of critical importance in translational biomedical science. Here we present COSMOS, a Python library for workflow management that allows formal description of pipelines and partitioning of jobs. In addition, it includes a user-interface for tracking the progress of jobs, abstraction of the queuing system and fine-grained control over the workflow. Workflows can be created on traditional computing clusters as well as cloud-based services. Availability and implementation: Source code is available for non-commercial purposes, in addition to documentation. Links to both are provided at http://lpm.hms.harvard.edu/ and http://wall-lab.stanford.edu.
