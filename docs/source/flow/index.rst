Writing Workflows
==================

The easiest way to write a workflow is to use the *ezflow* package.

.. py:module:: cosmos.flow

Cosmos has a powerful syntax for describing and construction workflows workflows.
Workflows are stored and visualized as a :term:`DAG` who's nodes are tasks (or jobs) and who's edges are job dependencies.
