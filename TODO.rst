TODO
--------
* change name of node to task
* create a cli for running a workflow so its not executed directly
* don't allow a user to add nodes to a successful batch without specifically setting a parameter.  Usually this is mistake caused by using the same name twice 
* capture all exceptions so that I can do a graceful exit
* prompt user with a 30s timeout if they're doing hard resets or restart_from_here()

Completed
+++++++++
* capture ctrl+c
