<p><strong>FOR ACADEMIC NON-COMMERCIAL RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY</strong></p>

<p>This Agreement is made between <strong>President and Fellows of Harvard College</strong>, an educational and charitable corporation existing under the laws and the constitution of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, having a place of business at Richard A. and Susan F. Smith Campus Center, Suite 727, 1350 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138 ("HARVARD") and the LICENSEE and is effective at the date the downloading is completed ("EFFECTIVE DATE").</p>

<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, LICENSEE desires to license the PROGRAM, as defined hereinafter, and HARVARD wishes to have this PROGRAM utilized in the public interest, subject only to the royalty-free, nonexclusive, nontransferable license rights of the United States Government pursuant to 48 CFR 52.227-14; and</p>

<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, LICENSEE desires to license the PROGRAM and HARVARD desires to grant a license on the following terms and conditions.</p>

<p><strong>NOW, THEREFORE</strong>, in consideration of the promises and covenants made herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:</p>

<p><strong>1. DEFINITIONS</strong></p>

<p>1.1 "PROGRAM" shall mean copyright in the object code and source code known as COSMOS and related documentation, if any, as they exist on the EFFECTIVE DATE and as downloadable from <a href="http://cosmos.hms.harvard.edu/">http://cosmos.hms.harvard.edu/</a> on the EFFECTIVE DATE.</p>

<p><strong>2. LICENSE</strong></p>

<p>2.1 Grant. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, HARVARD hereby grants to LICENSEE, solely for academic non-commercial research purposes, a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to: (a) download, execute and display the PROGRAM and (b) create bug fixes and modify the PROGRAM. [By downloading the PROGRAM, LICENSEE hereby accepts the limited use license granted herein and agrees to the terms set forth in this Agreement.]</p>

<p>The LICENSEE may apply the PROGRAM in a pipeline to data owned by users other than the LICENSEE and provide these users the results of the PROGRAM provided LICENSEE does so for academic non-commercial purposes only. For clarification purposes, academic sponsored research is not a commercial use under the terms of this Agreement.</p>

<p>2.2 No Sublicensing or Additional Rights. LICENSEE shall not sublicense or distribute the PROGRAM, in whole or in part, without prior written permission from HARVARD. LICENSEE shall ensure that all of its users agree to the terms of this Agreement. LICENSEE further agrees that it shall not put the PROGRAM on a network, server, or other similar technology that may be accessed by anyone other than the LICENSEE and its employees and users who have agreed to the terms of this agreement.</p>

<p>2.3 License Limitations. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to confer any rights upon LICENSEE by implication, estoppel, or otherwise to any computer software, trademark, intellectual property, or patent rights of HARVARD, or of any other entity, except as expressly granted herein. LICENSEE agrees that the PROGRAM, in whole or part, shall not be used for any commercial purpose, including without limitation, as the basis of a commercial software or hardware product or to provide services. LICENSEE further agrees that the PROGRAM shall not be copied or otherwise adapted in order to circumvent the need for obtaining a license for use of the PROGRAM.</p>

<p><strong>3. OWNERSHIP OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</strong></p>

<p>LICENSEE acknowledges that title to the PROGRAM shall remain with HARVARD. LICENSEE agrees to include appropriate attribution if any results obtained from use of the PROGRAM are included in any publication. The PROGRAM is marked with the following HARVARD copyright notice and notice of attribution to contributors. LICENSEE shall retain such notice on all copies:</p>

<p>Copyright Â© 2012-2014 President and Fellows of Harvard College ("Harvard"). All Rights Reserved.</p>

<p>Notice of attribution: The COSMOS program was made available through the generosity of the President and Fellows of Harvard College.</p>

<p>LICENSEE shall not use or register the name "Harvard" (alone or as part of another name) or any logos, seals, insignia or other words, names, symbols or devices that identify HARVARD or any HARVARD school, unit, division or affiliate ("Harvard Names") for any purpose except with the prior written approval of, and in accordance with restrictions required by, HARVARD, except as stated above for attribution purposes.</p>

<p><strong>4. INDEMNIFICATION</strong></p>

<p>LICENSEE shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless HARVARD, and its current and former directors, governing board members, trustees, officers, faculty, medical and professional staff, employees, students, and agents and their respective successors, heirs and assigns (collectively, the "Indemnitees"), from and against any liability, cost, expense, damage, deficiency, loss or obligation of any kind or nature (including reasonable attorneys' fees and other costs and expenses of litigation), incurred by or imposed upon any of the Indemnitees in connection with any claims, suits, actions, demands or judgments arising out of any theory of liability (including, without limitation, actions in the form of tort, warranty, or strict liability and regardless of whether such action has any factual basis) based upon, arising out of, or otherwise relating to any right or license granted under this Agreement and any use, modification or dissemination of the Program by Licensee.</p>

<p><strong>5. NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES</strong></p>

<p>THE PROGRAM IS DELIVERED "AS IS." HARVARD MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE PROGRAM OR THE COPYRIGHT, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. HARVARD EXTENDS NO WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND AS TO PROGRAM CONFORMITY WITH WHATEVER USER MANUALS OR OTHER LITERATURE MAY BE ISSUED FROM TIME TO TIME.  </p>

<p>IN NO EVENT SHALL HARVARD OR ITS RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATED INVESTIGATORS AND AFFILIATES BE LIABLE FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ECONOMIC DAMAGES OR INJURY TO PROPERTY AND LOST PROFITS, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER HARVARD SHALL BE ADVISED, SHALL HAVE OTHER REASON TO KNOW, OR IN FACT SHALL KNOW OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THE FOREGOING.</p>

<p><strong>6. ASSIGNMENT</strong></p>

<p>This Agreement is personal to LICENSEE and any rights or obligations assigned by LICENSEE without the prior written consent of HARVARD shall be null and void.</p>

<p><strong>7. MISCELLANEOUS</strong></p>

LICENSEE gives assurance that it will comply with all United States export control laws and regulations controlling the export of the PROGRAM, including, without limitation, all Export Administration Regulations of the United States Department of Commerce. Among other things, these laws and regulations prohibit, or require a license for, the export of certain types of software to specified countries. LICENSEE hereby gives written assurance that it will comply with all United States export control laws and regulations, that it bears sole responsibility for any violation of such laws and regulations, and that it will indemnify, defend, and hold HARVARD harmless (in accordance with Section 4) for the consequences of any such violation.</p>

<p>7.2 Termination. LICENSEE shall have the right to terminate this Agreement for any reason upon prior written notice to HARVARD. If LICENSEE breaches any provision hereunder, and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days, HARVARD may terminate this Agreement immediately.

Any waiver of any rights or failure to act in a specific instance shall relate only to such instance and shall not be construed as an agreement to waive any rights or fail to act in any other instance, whether or not similar. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among the parties with respect to its subject matter and supersedes prior agreements or understandings between the parties relating to its subject matter.</p>

<p>7.6 Binding Effect; Headings. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns. All headings are for convenience only and shall not affect the meaning of any provision of this Agreement.</p>
